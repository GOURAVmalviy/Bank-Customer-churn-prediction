# Bank-Customer-churn-prediction
To analyze customer behavior and identify key factors leading to churn, then build a predictive model to forecast churn risk and design actionable retention strategies.
# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy – Telco Dataset

This project analyzes customer behavior to predict churn and offers actionable strategies to improve retention. It includes data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, feature importance, and a Power BI dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 📊 Performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 7,000+ telecom customers
- 🛠 Built a predictive churn classification model using Logistic Regression and XGBoost (82% accuracy)
- 📈 Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard for stakeholder insights
- 💡 Identified key churn drivers and suggested business strategies for retention

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand patterns behind customer churn in telecom industry
- Build a predictive model to identify high-risk customers
- Design a dashboard for churn insights (by contract, tenure, services)
- Propose actionable retention strategies

## 🧪 Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and cleaned categorical fields
- Feature encoding: Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding
- Created new features like `Tenure Group`, `Services Used`, and `AutoPay Flag`

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized churn distribution by:
  - Contract type
  - Monthly charges
  - Tech support and online backup
- Used correlation heatmaps, histograms, and pie charts

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Selected XGBoost for deployment (82% accuracy, 76% recall)

### 4. Power BI Dashboard
- KPIs: Total Churn %, Monthly Charges, Avg Tenure
- Visual filters for:
  - Contract Type
  - Internet Services
  - Region / Gender
- Drill-throughs: Customer Segments, High-Risk Profiles

### 5. Business Insights & Retention Strategy
- High churn among month-to-month customers without tech support
- Key recommendations:
  - Bundle essential services (internet, tech support)
  - Loyalty discounts after 6 months
  - Prepaid annual contracts with benefits
