# Bank-Customer-churn-prediction
To analyze customer behavior and identify key factors leading to churn, then build a predictive model to forecast churn risk and design actionable retention strategies.
# ðŸ§  Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy â€“ Bank Customer Dataset

This project analyzes customer behavior to predict churn and offers actionable strategies to improve retention. It includes data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, feature importance, and a Power BI dashboard.

## ðŸ§ª Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and cleaned categorical fields.
- Feature encoding: Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding.


### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized churn distribution by:
  - Contract type
  - Monthly charges
  - Tech support and online backup.
- Used correlation heatmaps, histograms, and pie charts.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and machine learning models.
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Recall.
- Selected XGBoost for deployment (85% accuracy, 76% recall).

### 4. Power BI Dashboard
- KPIs: Total Churn %, Monthly Charges, Avg Tenure.
- Visual filters for:
  - Contract Type
  - Internet Services
  - Region / Gender
- Drill-throughs: Customer Segments, High-Risk Profiles.

### 5. Business Insights & Retention Strategy
- High churn among month-to-month customers without tech support.
- Key recommendations:
  - Bundle essential services (internet, tech support).
  - Loyalty discounts after 6 months.
  - Prepaid annual contracts with benefits.
